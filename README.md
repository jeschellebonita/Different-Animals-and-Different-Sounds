Project Description:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around objects that represent real-world entities and their interactions. The key concepts in OOP include inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, which together create a robust structure for building flexible and scalable applications. This code snippet demonstrates these concepts through a simple example involving animals and their distinct sounds. In this code, we define a base class, Animal, which represents a generic animal with a common characteristic: a name. The class has an abstract method, speak(), which each subclass must implement to define their unique sound. Subclasses Dog, Cat, and Duck inherit from Animal, each providing its specific implementation of the speak() method, illustrating the concept of polymorphism. Encapsulation is demonstrated through the _name attribute, indicating that it is intended for internal use. The class provides a public method to retrieve the name, maintaining control over how the attribute is accessed and modified. The snippet also includes a function, animal_sound(), that accepts an Animal object and calls its speak() method. This function showcases polymorphism because it can work with any object derived from Animal, allowing for flexibility in handling different types of animals without specific checks or conditions.
